This anddroid application is just a loop that will alternate the plane mode ON/OFF until my ip is the one I want.

Your phone must be ROOTED or nothing will work.

Version used: Android studio 4.1.3

SDK installed are 
11R Level 30 (30.0.3)
6 LVL 23

Plug the phone with the Mac once detected y studio code open a terminal 

just copy and paste the content of install.sh in a terminal (direct run fails the first time for some reason I will find later)
then '. install.sh'

The app should automatically open on the phone.

then click on reset io button and wait.

OS_NAME="Darwin"
OS_VERSION="11.2"
OS_ARCH="x86_64"
